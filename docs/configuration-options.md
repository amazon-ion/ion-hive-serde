# SerDe Properties
The following SerDe properties can be used to configure SerDe behavior when serializing and
deserializing.

**WARNING**: property documentation is being added as they are implemented.

## Encoding
Indicates whether the data will be serialized as Ion text or Ion binary.

```
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
"encoding" = "<BINARY | TEXT>" -- default: BINARY
)
```

## Default Offset
Hive timestamps are "interpreted to be timezoneless and stored as an offset from the UNIX epoch",
[ref](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Types#LanguageManualTypes-timestamp).
Ion timestamps however have an offset, this configuration option determines what offset to use when
serializing to Ion.

```
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
    "timestamp.serialization_offset" = "<OFFSET>" -- default: "Z"
)
```

`OFFSET` is represented as `<signal>hh:mm`, examples: `01:00`, `+01:00`, `-09:30`, `Z` (UTC, same
as `00:00`), see [timestamp](http://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/docs/spec.html#timestamp) specification
for more details.

## Serialize null columns:
The SerDe can be configured to serialize or skip columns with null values. User can choose to write out strongly typed
nulls or untyped nulls. Strongly typed nulls type will be determined based on the default Ion to Hive type mapping

Specification:
```
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
   "serialize_null" = "<OMIT | UNTYPED | TYPED>" -- default: OMIT
)
```

Example:
```
-- Table
| id | name    |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Foo Bar |
| 2  | null    |

-- Serialized with "serialize_null" = "TYPED"
{id: 1, name: "Foo Bar"}
{id: 2, name: null.string}

-- Serialized with "serialize_null" = "UNTYPED"
{id: 1, name: "Foo Bar"}
{id: 2, name: null}

-- Serialized with "serialize_null" = "OMIT"
{id: 1, name: "Foo Bar"}
{id: 2}
```
